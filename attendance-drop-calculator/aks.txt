## ✅ Step-by-Step: Get AdSense Approval on First Try

---

### ✅ 1. Add **Privacy Policy** + **Terms of Service**

These are **non-negotiable requirements** for AdSense. They make your site legally compliant and trustworthy.

#### 📜 Why They Matter:

Google checks that:

* You clearly explain **how you use data**
* You comply with **GDPR and advertising rules**
* You aren’t **hiding anything from users**

#### ✍️ What to Include

##### 🔐 **Privacy Policy** should include:

* What data you collect (e.g., cookies, IP, usage tracking)
* Whether you use third-party tools (e.g., AdSense, analytics)
* How you protect user data
* A contact method for privacy concerns

##### 📄 **Terms of Service** should include:

* Basic rules of use (e.g., “Use at your own risk”)
* Any warranties or disclaimers
* Who owns the content or data
* How you handle misuse

#### ✅ Where to Place Them:

* Create 2 separate pages:

  * `/privacy.html`
  * `/terms.html`
* Link to them in the footer of every page
* Example:

  ```html
  <footer class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-8">
    <a href="/privacy.html" class="underline">Privacy Policy</a> |
    <a href="/terms.html" class="underline">Terms of Service</a>
  </footer>
  ```

### ✅ 2. Prepare the Site for AdSense

Here’s what Google looks for:

| ✅ Requirement             | 👀 What Google Checks                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Original content**      | Even if tool-based, add a few paragraphs about your service        |
| **No broken pages/links** | Everything must work, including mobile                             |
| **Legal pages**           | As above – Privacy & Terms                                         |
| **Real user activity**    | Should have 10–20 daily users over a few days                      |
| **Professional layout**   | No half-broken pages or “under construction”                       |
| **Custom domain**         | `thingdoms.web.app` can work, but a `.com` custom domain is better |

#### 🧠 Pro Tip:

* Create a simple **About page** and explain your tool, who it's for, and how it helps users. Google loves transparency.

---

### ✅ 3. Apply to AdSense (Smartly)

#### 📌 Timing Matters:

Wait until:

* You’ve added legal pages
* You’ve had at least **10–30 real users/day** for 5+ days
* Your site looks **polished and responsive**

#### 📌 Where to Apply:

* Go to: [https://www.google.com/adsense/start/](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
* Sign in with your Gmail
* Enter your domain (e.g., `thingdoms.web.app` or your custom one)
* Add the AdSense verification code to your `<head>`

Let me know if you need help placing it.

#### ⚠️ Be Honest:

Don’t fake traffic or use AI-generated blog spam. You **don’t need a blog** — but you **do need transparency + real usage**.
