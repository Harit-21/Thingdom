            <h1>The 75% Inquisition</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">It's a number etched into the mind of almost every student: 75%. It’s the line between
                safety and peril, the most common attendance requirement in institutions worldwide. But is it truly a
                magic number, or just an arbitrary rule? Let's investigate.</p>

            <p>To master a system, you must first understand it. Seeing the 75% rule as a mere hurdle to be cleared is a
                novice's mistake. A true strategist—an alchemist—seeks to understand the *why* behind the rule. This
                knowledge is what transforms compliance into control.</p>

            <h2>Why Does the 75% Rule Even Exist?</h2>
            <p>This policy isn't born from a desire to micromanage your life. It's rooted in a combination of
                pedagogical theory, administrative necessity, and professional preparation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning by Osmosis:</strong> Education isn't just about passively receiving information.
                    True learning happens in the environment—the questions your classmates ask, the professor's
                    off-the-cuff remarks, the subtle shift in tone that signals a key concept. By being physically
                    present, you engage in "learning by osmosis," absorbing knowledge that never makes it into the
                    lecture notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Discipline and Accountability:</strong> University is a training ground for the professional
                    world. A core tenet of any job is simply showing up. Attendance policies are a low-stakes way to
                    instill the discipline of consistency and accountability, skills that are far more valuable than any
                    single lecture's content.</li>
                <li><strong>Accreditation and Compliance:</strong> Often, the rule is not entirely the university's
                    choice. Educational accrediting bodies and government regulations often mandate a minimum number of
                    "contact hours" for a course to be considered valid. The 75% rule is a straightforward way for
                    institutions to prove they are meeting these standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Debate: Is It the *Right* Number?</h2>
            <p>The 75% figure is a pragmatic compromise. It demands a significant majority of attendance (3 out of every
                4 classes) while still providing a generous 25% buffer for illness, emergencies, and personal days. It's
                easy to measure and simple to enforce across thousands of students.</p>
            <p>However, it's far from perfect. Critics argue that it measures presence, not engagement. A student can be
                in the room but mentally absent, while another could master the material from home. It can unfairly
                penalize students with chronic health issues or significant personal responsibilities. The truth is,
                there is no "perfect" number. 75% is simply the widely accepted equilibrium point between institutional
                requirements and student flexibility.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Compliance: A Strategic Approach</h2>
            <p>Don't just aim to meet the 75% target. Instead, view your 25% buffer not as an entitlement to be spent,
                but as a strategic resource to be managed. This is the core principle of the <a
                    href="/tools/attendance-calculator.html">Attendance Alchemist</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Front-Load Your Buffer:</strong> Strive for 100% attendance at the start of the semester.
                    This builds the largest possible buffer, giving you maximum flexibility later on when you might
                    genuinely need it for an unexpected opportunity or emergency.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage Your Skips:</strong> Not all classes are equal. Skipping a hands-on lab or a
                    participation-heavy seminar is far more costly than missing a large lecture where the notes are
                    posted online. If you must use your buffer, spend it on the classes with the lowest academic impact.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communicate Like a Professional:</strong> If you know you'll be absent, send your professor
                    a brief, professional email beforehand. This small act of courtesy shows respect and maturity, and
                    can make a world of difference if you ever find yourself on the borderline of the attendance
                    requirement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately, the 75% rule isn't magic. It's a system. And like any system, it can be navigated with
                intelligence and foresight. By understanding its purpose and managing your attendance as a strategic
                asset, you move from being a passive subject to an active master of your academic journey.</p>
